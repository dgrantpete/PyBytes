# PyBytes
An Open Source work-in-progress library to better manipulate bytes for I/O operations. Built around MicroPython functionality to interface with microcontrollers. Works perfectly fine in regular Python with slightly less optimization than could be otherwise possible.

Long Term Goal: Convert as much Python code to C/C++ to provide abstraction and better performance, while still retaining Pythonic exterior interface, functionality, and error handling.
